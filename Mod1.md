Client-server model
example: coffee shop
*Morgan - server
- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) - virtual server
*me - Client

principle for aws:
"you only pay for what you use"
key value:
"pay for what you need"

>> What is a client-server model?
In computing, a client can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests to computer servers. A server can be services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) â€“ a type of virtual server.

For example, suppose that a client makes a request for a news article, the score in an online game, or a funny video. The server evaluates the details of this request and fulfills it by returning the information to the client.

def: The on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing

**Undifferentiated heavy lifting of IT: repetitve tasks (AWS jobs)

The three cloud computing deployment models are: 
    cloud-based: 
        + Run al parts of the app in the cloud.
        + Migrate existing apps to the cloud.
        + Design and build new apps in the cloud. 
        ++ For example, a company might create an application consisting of virtual servers, databases, and networking components that are fully based in the cloud.

    on-premises aka private cloud:
        + Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools
        + Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies.
        ++ For example, you might have applications that run on technology that is fully kept in your on-premises data center. Though this model is much like legacy IT infrastructure, its incorporation of application management and virtualization technologies helps to increase resource utilization.

    hybrid:
        + Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure.
        + Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications.
        ++ For example, suppose that a company wants to use cloud services that can automate batch data processing and analytics. However, the company has several legacy applications that are more suitable on premises and will not be migrated to the cloud. With a hybrid deployment, the company would be able to keep the legacy applications on premises while benefiting from the data and analytics services that run in the cloud.
